// 1. 	determine the fractal space coordinate of the point this pixel covers
// 		this is done because we pass fractal space borders to the "rect" structured buffer, and that rect is being projected to the texture
// 2. 	set pixel color depending on the amount of iterations required to move the point out of R = 2 circle

	note:
	id parameter contains the three dimentional index of the thread
	we decided to have 1024 x 1024 threads to have one thread per 1024 x 1024 pixels of our texture
	so, number of the thread is also a number of the pixel
	id.xy is two dimentional index of the pixel
	instead we could use this form:
	textureOut[int2(id.x, id.y)] to reference the pixel the thread is responsible of

	also:
	In this particular example I used double type to increase the depth of fractal zooming, but still precision can be reahed after 15 orders of zooming
	But float type would work faster, so if you want higher performance - don't use the types as small as you can afford for your data
