Vella + Athena dialogue

V:I gotta ask you something.
V:Have you ever met somebody, who makes you feel like a completely different person?
A:How do you mean?
V:I just feel like no matter how hard we try to be ourselves, that definition is always shifting to fit our surroundings.
V:Is there really a true "me", or just a different version of myself for each situation? -shitty line
A:This is starting to sound like an identity crisis to me.
V:Well yeah, a little. But in a good way!
A:Okay...
V:Bear with me here. You don't think you're perfect right?
A:Right.
V:Well don't you always strive to be greater than you are?
A:Sure.
V:Imagine someone came along who inspired so strongly that you tried harder than you ever thought yourself capable,
V:And you changed so much that you almost didn't recognize yourself anymore.


Revolutionary Speech

And so *ancient commander* led his forces, as vast as the ocean, in an assault upon Othrys. He pushed them back further than any man had ever done before, but in the end was defeated.
His flood of warriors was pushed back. Back beyond the lands of study and spirituality, forced past the lands of revelry and repetitions.
They found refuge in the outlands, and they've been the homelands of righteous fury ever since. 
SHIT LINE -> Although the tide of war had turned in our enemy's favour, a new generation soon rose to take *commander*'s place.
And thus, like the tide we rise and fall, crashing upon the shores of our enemy. 
We, an unstoppable force of nature, will erode their structures, their unnatural order, over as many centuries as it takes.
One day, their cold and uncaring walls will crack, and it will all come crashing down.
