#IN DEPTH STORY PLAN FOR ACT 1#
###############################

ACT 1 must stand out in order to grab attention

Open with cinematics, and some mysterious philosophical shit.


THE VILLAGE ####################

Player's village is being raided by Othrys forces. Player is with their parents as they're captured in their home.
Parents urge player to run, starting a chase sequence which is used as a tutorial to teach basic movement.
Player runs through the forest away from enemies, but is eventually cut off and forced to fight for the first time.
After defeating their first enemy, reinforcements show up and beat the player down. This will demonstrate the importance of strength numbers in Project Fulcrum.

The player is taken to a prison camp where they are introduced to the Token and Conversation systems.


THE PRISON #####################

The player is deposited in a labor camp, where they're introduced to four new characters, and forced to pick only 2 of them to rescue and add to the party.
