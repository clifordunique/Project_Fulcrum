8:18 PM - Jegschemesch: i played your game and fell to my death
8:18 PM - Jegschemesch: do you know what is causing the slowdown?
8:18 PM - Chonks: :D
8:19 PM - Chonks: is there lag?
8:19 PM - Jegschemesch: occasionally the it gets real framey
8:19 PM - Chonks: hrmm
8:19 PM - Chonks: I haven't encountered that yet
8:19 PM - Chonks: could be system dependent
8:19 PM - Jegschemesch: what resolution to you play it at?
8:19 PM - Jegschemesch: i was 1080 windowed
8:20 PM - Chonks: 1080p
8:20 PM - Chonks: if you click and draw a small circle on the screen it opens a console
8:20 PM - Chonks: if there's any errors that may be related it'll show them there
8:20 PM - Chonks: also if you want to respawn hit F2
8:21 PM - Chonks: also let me know if any part of the tutorial segment was unclear, or if any game mechanics are annoying
8:22 PM - Jegschemesch: might have something to do with premiere which i had open
8:23 PM - Jegschemesch: i think it's too hard to do an angled jump from rest
8:23 PM - Jegschemesch: is the angle based entirely on momentum?
8:23 PM - Jegschemesch: because it takes a while to get any momentum
8:23 PM - Chonks: there is a small amount of horizontal force but not much
8:23 PM - Jegschemesch: so i hit right and then jump, but even though i hold right for a good moment or two, my character still jumps straight up
8:23 PM - Chonks: if you super jump you can get going pretty good though
8:24 PM - Jegschemesch: the charge thing is strange, how many charges can you do for one jump?
8:24 PM - Chonks: also you can superjump without any powerup
8:24 PM - Chonks: oh yeah it's 1 charge level per jump
8:24 PM - Chonks: but the higher level, the more powerful a jump
8:25 PM - Chonks: so your first jump is the strongest, and each one after is weaker until you deplete your power
8:25 PM - Jegschemesch: is that why you chang3e color?
8:26 PM - Chonks: yeah
8:26 PM - Jegschemesch: shouldn't releaseing s after charging do the jump instead of having to hit space?
8:26 PM - Chonks: all placeholder
8:26 PM - Chonks: nah because I want the player to be able to do a series of actions after charging instead of just one jump
8:26 PM - Jegschemesch: and i think max charge should take only a few presses of q
8:27 PM - Chonks: keeps them in the action more
8:27 PM - Chonks: hmmm
8:27 PM - Jegschemesch: oh so if charged, you do the special charge jump\
8:28 PM - Jegschemesch: it doesn't affect your normal jump
8:28 PM - Chonks: nope
8:28 PM - Chonks: it just makes crouch jumps stronger
8:28 PM - Chonks: you can crouch jump without power though
8:28 PM - Chonks: and that is still stronger than a normal jump
8:28 PM - Chonks: horizontally anyway
8:29 PM - Chonks: anyway I'm going to have it so if you get nearly perfect on the circle timing thing, the max amount of charges goes up, so that you can have an even more powerful jump
8:30 PM - Chonks: like the outer limiting circle expands to let more rings in
8:30 PM - Jegschemesch: the whole charge thing seems unnecessary right now becuase it just takes time to do rather than real effort
8:31 PM - Chonks: yeah true
8:31 PM - Jegschemesch: do you need some way of limiting the player's energy?
8:31 PM - Chonks: it's kind of an incomplete system at the moment
8:31 PM - Jegschemesch: it could just regen automatically after a very short time
8:31 PM - Chonks: I wanted to have some kind of skill based system, where good players could jump higher and hit harder
8:32 PM - Jegschemesch: i also couldn't figure out the running strike
8:32 PM - Chonks: maybe not the most elegant solution
8:32 PM - Chonks: oh you just hold down left click while running fast
8:32 PM - Jegschemesch: left click first or run first?
8:32 PM - Chonks: and after ~1 second you get a comet trail
8:32 PM - Chonks: then just run into something
8:32 PM - Chonks: doesn't matter
8:32 PM - Chonks: all that matters is a high speed is maintained and you hold left click
8:33 PM - Chonks: but if you lose the comet trail you have to click and hold again
8:33 PM - Chonks: which needs to be patched
8:33 PM - Jegschemesch: yeah, it's not busing the wall
8:33 PM - Jegschemesch: only way i busted the wall was by jumping up to the left and getting high speed
8:34 PM - Chonks: yeah you need to get a running start from up the ramp
8:34 PM - Chonks: did you break it without the comet punch?
8:34 PM - Jegschemesch: don't think so
8:34 PM - Jegschemesch: just worked now
8:34 PM - Jegschemesch: but i swear i did the same thing twice before
8:34 PM - Jegschemesch: does it take multiple hits?
8:35 PM - Chonks: it has a certain threshold
8:35 PM - Chonks: of momentum
8:35 PM - Chonks: so it might've been too slow
8:35 PM - Chonks: I tried to get it to the right balance so that you can only break it with a comet punch
8:35 PM - Chonks: but might be dialled up too high
8:36 PM - Chonks: quick question
8:36 PM - Chonks: when you left click does it throw a punch every time?
8:36 PM - Chonks: or is it dropping inputs
8:36 PM - Jegschemesch: hmm, i don't see a punch while running
8:36 PM - Chonks: it just randomly started doing that when I switched machines and I'm not sure if it's the computer or the game
8:36 PM - Chonks: I just mean standing still
8:36 PM - Chonks: without holding
8:37 PM - Jegschemesch: yeah, just restarted and for a few seconds it wouldn't register the clicks
8:37 PM - Chonks: hmmm
8:37 PM - Chonks: k good to know
8:38 PM - Jegschemesch: if i run back and forth, it's very inconsistent whether i punch or not
8:39 PM - Chonks: oh you can't punch backwards
8:39 PM - Chonks: but it should probably just punch forwards in that case
8:39 PM - Chonks: I'm gonna write that down
8:40 PM - Jegschemesch: oh yeah, that makes sense, but maybe it should jsut punch in the facing direction if the player is moving then
8:40 PM - Chonks: mhm
8:42 PM - Chonks: btw hidden mechanic:
8:42 PM - Chonks: if you have power, and press jump and a direction in midair, you can bounce in that direction
8:42 PM - Jegschemesch: is there something you can do about the camera? the player gets very far ahead of the camera when running
8:42 PM - Chonks: kind of like a double jump but it preserves momentum rather than adding it
8:43 PM - Jegschemesch: in general I'd say the movement and running is too fast, so slowing it down would help that a bit
8:43 PM - Jegschemesch: is that the line i see sometimes appear when i'm in the air?
8:43 PM - Jegschemesch: i thought i was hitting invisible geomtetry
8:44 PM - Chonks: yeah
8:44 PM - Chonks: it's like a trampoline
8:44 PM - Chonks: I guess I need to make that less accessible somehow
8:45 PM - Jegschemesch: yewah, i wasn't sure how i was triggering it
8:46 PM - Chonks: btw F1 triggers godmode, which lets you fly by clicking where you want to go
8:46 PM - Chonks: try flying up into the clouds
8:50 PM - Chonks: also F5 locks the camera which you might find more to your liking
