	JOM BRAKAS, THE BIPARTITE
	"Wake me up when we're about to die"
	
		Home Province: Lateria
		*Act 1 Candidate*
		Terrifyingly fierce fighter, but narcoleptic and unwilling to fight most of the time.
		Man whose presence is split between an arca and a human body. 
		After being imprisoned and thought dead by his friends, they tried to bring him back through an arcan binding.
		Having been left in solitary confinement for so long, his mind had faded, loosening his spirit from his body and allowing him to be bound to a shell while still alive.
		He's unable to be fully aware in both bodies at once, and so leaves one sleeping while controlling the other. 
		He is attending to matters very important to him with his arcan body, which is with his family.
		This has the effect of making his human self seem lazy and narcoleptic to the player, who doesn't know of his predicament.

		
	GAZKAN NOYCLAH, THE WISE CRACKING OLD MAN
	"I'm just trying to lighten the mood!"
	
		Home Province: ???
		An old man who joined the warband without being asked to, and frequently remarks with terrible jokes at inappropriate times.
		Is usually asked to leave, which he does, albeit temporarily.
		Comic relief character.
		Laughs obnoxiously at his own offensive jokes.
		Has nearly no screen time outside of his comical intrusions.
		
		He is actually a secret agent working for the enemy, who infiltrated the group with the intention of leaking information. 
		This leads to a spy scare subplot and the option to kick a suspected infiltrator out of the party.
		
	JURIOUS PYLE, AKA SGT.PYLE, THE WARTORN
	"I'll give you a hint at how I'm feeling: it rhymes with my name. And no, I'm not feeling curious."
	
		Home Province: Vasculos
		-
		Battle scarred commander, conflicted by the things he saw at war. Very opinionated and bull-headed ally, but well intentioned.
		Kind of like Kenny from the Walking Dead games, but less annoyingly contrarian.
		
	VELLA MOROMA, THE KEEPER
	"Quote"
	
		Home Province: Vasculos
		Sent at a young age to learn in Cerobos because of her natural talent.
	
	SOLENOID "SOL" HANSMOORE, THE LOST
	"Quote"
	
		Home Province: Cerobos
		He was named after the first electrical component he selected from a box, as is tradition in Cerobos.
		Not particularly smart, especially by Cerobos standards. He thinks in unorthodox ways, however, leading to breakthroughs unconcievable by common researchers.
		Classified by the Cerobos Academic Command as 'Divergent Type', because of his usefully unique mindset. He is considered quite valuable despite his generally poor performance.
	
	SILVA KOZO, THE PROPAGANDIST
	"The people need to see this!"
	
		Home Province: Hedonia
		*Act 1 Candidate*
		A talented sculptor of public opinion. Her journalistic integrity got her in trouble with the Othryc Council, who sent her to an outland labour camp.
		
		
	ROSKA OZEHR, THE CONSPIRACY THEORIST
	"You say none of the things I worry about ever happen? It's because of my vigilance that they don't!"
		
		Home Province: Hedonia
		-Extreme paranoia, which is actually often justified.
		-Long, messy, black hair with straight bangs
		-Looks like a total mess, bags under eyes
		Runs a conspiracy theory blog describing real government pacification measures being used to control the populace. 
		Wears a gas mask to prevent the effects of the pacifying agent. 
	
	ESTIEL REGNIS, THE LEGACY
	"There is nothing more dangerous than an ignorant man with something to lose."
		
		Home Province: Lateria
		Ruler of a long gone civilization. Had his devout followers brainwashed to wish for his immortality, 
		then had them all killed in the hopes that their combined will would manifest. 
		He has lived for 300 years after successfully attaining immortality. In that time he has experienced much, and come to regret far more.
		He now lives in solitude in his former temple, wasting his days sculpting endlessly to occupy himself.
		Believing to have seen all the good and bad the world has to offer, Estiel has become jaded and no longer wishes to be a part of worldly affairs.
		A certain fiery spirited rebel just might rekindle his faith in humanity, however.
		
	ATHENA VERGRYP, THE USURPER, HEIRESS OF AVARICE
	"Composition. Motive. Delivery. Deniability. All components of a good lie."
	
		Home Province: Outlands
		Daughter of the leaders of a rebellion, the likes of which the world had never seen before or since.

WORLD BUILDING #####################################################

	Arca/Arcan, name for those brought back to life via arcan binding
	
	When a massacre takes place, it causes it to rain. This is from the influx of tragic emotions into the aether.
	
	Every person is born with a link to the aether, giving them a small amount of agency over cause and effect. 
	For example, one connected to the aether might find it much easier to find their car keys than one without.
	Could be thought of as a positive influence on "luck".
	
	Those who have broken their link to the aether are thought to be cursed, due to their very apparent loss of the benefits it provides.

	A man described the Aether as being such: Strings; infinitely thin and unfathomably long strings soaring in every direction, perfectly straight all the while.
	The deeper you look the more the strings intertwine, until they form into thick braided ropes.
	
	Athena learning to interact with the Aether: 'I can't see the strings, but somehow, I can sense them there. Like a strand of spider's web.'
	
	Olympus was destroyed in the first rebellion. A powerful nuclear weapon destroyed the mountain, 
	and in the process wiped out much of the original technology of earth due to the EMP. 
	A massive boulder from the mountain was flung into Vasculos, where it was hollowed out and made into a city. 
	Vasculosan legends say the founder of Vasculos placed it there, proving his strength.
	
	The presence of the aether had a subtle effect on conventional physics, creating a new column of elements on the periodic table.
	
HISTORY ##########################################################
	
	Original Project Fulcrum Science Team ########################
		A group of highly certified experts were assembled to oversee Project Fulcrum on P7.
	
		Physiologist - Vasculos
 		Project Overseer - Othrys
		Psychologist - Hedonia
		Botanist - Outlands
		Engineer - Cerebos
		Aetheric Specialist - Lateria

	E2016-E2103 ######################################################
		Earth is barren and low on resources. No hospitable planets exist within viable travelling distance of earth. 
		Earth population is 296 million, 1/25th of its former size. The rich elite still survive while the working class wastes away through lack of health care and food shortages.
		The aether is discovered; Its power is harnessed to open pocket dimensions with lush worlds suitable for the upper class.
		Pocket Seven is formed. The large circular plateau below the entry point was quickly terraformed to fit the project's specifications, and was dubbed AXIS.
		The scientists of Pocket 7 begin work on PROJECT FULCRUM, with the goal of linking the aether to humans.
		Pocket 7 is unpopulated. It's colonization was delayed to determine if Project Fulcrum produced safe conditions.
		A pact is made between a group of pocket dimension projects to evacuate the lower class and sever their connections to earth in a mass exodus.
		On Dec XX, 2103, Pockets 7, 8, and 10 staged a short-lived coup, buying enough time to shepherd an estimated 270,000 people through the gateways.
		Pocket 7 was only able to take in 43,000 refugees before the decision was made to sever connection to earth. The military and leadership did not make it.
		The PROJECT FULCRUM science team was put in charge due to their experience and extensive knowledge of AXIS.
		
	A1-A5 ###############################################################
		
		Settlement of axis begins. 
		The botanist immediately assembles an expedition to lower altitude in search of arable land. 
		Once a steady food supply was established, the Engineer travelled to the mineral-rich mountains of Cerebos to develop industry on AXIS.
		The Aetherist traced Aether flows and found strong concentrations to study in Lateria.
		The Physiologist found the elevation at which air composition was the healthiest, and encouraged people to settle there.
		The Project Overseer set up a base of operations on the high mountain of Othrys for its clear line of sight and distance from the former gateway, in case of earthly attack.
		The botanist remained at the foot of Olympus, improving agriculture operations to suit the new climate.

#GAME STATES#
#############

There are three distinct game states, with different mechanics accompanying each. Battle, Social, and Tactical.
	
BATTLE ##################################################
	
	The 'high speed action and combat' game state. Physically simulated platformer combat. Orthographic 2D side-on perspective. High graphical fidelity.

SOCIAL ##################################################

	This state is played out on a small, rpg exploration style map, usually only encompassing the player's base camp. 2D, Low Angle Top-Down perspective. 
	No physics, just linear WASD movement of character. Interact with objects or characters in the scene to trigger dialogue. 
	Low graphical fidelity; characters are presented as 1-2 colour cutouts with low fps sprite animations. These are the Cutout Sprites.
	Upon triggering dialogue, the player and character will appear on opposing sides of the screen with full detail upper bodies taking up most of the vertical space.
	These high detail sprites are the Actor Sprites, and will emote based on the dialogue taking place. 
	Between/behind them, the low detail scene continues, where the Cutout sprites of the characters might act out the events taking place in low detail. 
	This will make it more feasible to bring hundreds of interactions to life without requiring too much effort.

TACTICAL ################################################	
	
	There is no controllable character in this mode, only a map and menus.
	This is where the management component of the game is played. A symbolic, unrealistic, perspective map of AXIS is the main feature of this state. 
	Each region can be highlighted and clicked on after being unlocked, and from there they can be viewed top-down in higher detail. 
	Nodes dot each region, denoting places of interest that the player can travel to. 
	Menus let the player manage supplies, modify tactics, and read log entries on characters and enemies to learn more about the world.
	
############################
#GENERAL GAMEPLAY MECHANICS#
############################

WARBAND ############################################################
	The player is tasked with leading a warband across the harsh landscapes of *world*, keeping them safe and motivated.
	The warband consists of: 1) the leading party(LP), and 2) the masses.
		1) The leading party(LP) consists of important characters and active battle companions.
		2) The masses are a large force of grunt fighters that make up the bulk of the warband. They serve a less direct purpose.
		   The masses can be sent into battles to lessen the amount of forces the LP must fight. 
		   A larger amount of supporting fighters are often needed to deal with obstacles and conflicts.

TOKENS/BOONS #######################################################
	Gained through combat and actions, and used in dialogue to open extra speech options.
	This has the effect of tying playstyle to conversation style which could be very unique, but also dangerous territory if they conflict with the player.
	Con: Could also encourage savescumming to get the right dialogue option.

	Mettle - trading blows while at very low health.
	Courage - taking a fight against a superior foe.
	Conviction - drive to continue in your mission.
	Fucks To Give - joke token, always at 0.
	Patience - Used to unlock expository dialogue options. - Talking wide.
	Persistence - Used to dig deeper into a conversation. - Talking deep.
	
CONVERSATION ######################################################
	Conversation plays a large role in Project Fulcrum
	Each Leading Character(LC) has emotion values which are affected by dialogue choices.
	Each LC acts based on their emotion values. For example one who is too angry may attack the player, or one who isn't confident might desert the warband.
	
SPEECHES###########################################################

	The player will occasionally be prompted to make a speech in front of the warband, which affects the mood of the leading characters as well as overall morale.
	Certain concerns can be addressed with regards to recent events, with story implications.
	Serves as a closing and opening point to new chapters of the story.
	As usual, tokens can be spent to unlock special dialogue options.

MINDSCAPE #########################################################
	Area inside the character's own mind, traversable like an ordinary level.
	A place for the player to upgrade certain attributes of their character.
	The physical limiter is found here and can be bypassed to provide temporarily heightened strength, for a price.
	A battle could be fought here maybe?

SECOND IN COMMAND #################################################

	The player will be prompted to select a second in command, to act as their right hand man. 
	This will have emotional effects as well as provide bonuses (or penalties) to speeches.
	
	
PUBLIC SUPPORT ####################################################
	
	Each region will have a SUPPORT BAR, measuring public opinion of the rebellion. It will have 3 segments: Opposing, Neutral/Unsure, and Supporting.
	Propaganda will slowly convert supporters and neutral parties to the opposing side, but the effect will lessen when their propaganda machine is dismantled in Hedonia.
	Neutral population can be won over through liberation of specific locations, while Opposing population must be first made Neutral through public messages or acts of kindness.
	Locations cannot be liberated if there is no neutral population, only occupied.

INTERDICTION ######################################################
EXECRATION ########################################################


########
#COMBAT#
########

VIGOR #############################################################

	Health and Stamina are replaced with one resource, Vigor. It starts very high and over the course of a battle slowly depletes. 
	Combatants can take a lot of hits before going down in Project Fulcrum. You can also attempt to exhaust an enemy's vigor by evading them to tire them out.
	Vigor can be temporarily boosted in a variety of ways including support abilities and mental bypass (see MINDSCAPE).
	Denoted by a big 'power level' style bar that goes across the bottom of the screen and up the left side.
