[[&quot;Ugh, where am I?&quot;]]
[[&quot;It hurts. Bad.&quot;]]
[[&quot;W-Who are you?&quot;]]
[[&quot;Fuck I&#39;m dizzy.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Advancing" tags="" position="713,1494">&quot;So, what did you do to offend the mighty othrys?&quot;


&quot;Nothing! We were just a small farming village.&quot;</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="&quot;It hurts. Bad.&quot;" tags="" position="400,402">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll bet. I thought I saw skull when they dragged you in here. You owe me half a roll of toilet paper by the way. Had to keep you from bleeding all over my cell somehow.&quot;

[[&quot;Ugh, where am I?&quot;]]
[[Yeah sure, whatever.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="&quot;W-Who are you?&quot;" tags="" position="879,404">&quot;Name&#39;s Morris, you?&quot;

[[&quot;I&#39;m X&quot;]]

[[&quot;How did I get here?!&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="&quot;I&#39;m X&quot;" tags="" position="864,592">&quot;X, eh? Well tell me X, what did you do to offend the mighty Othrys to be sent here?&quot;

[[&quot;Nothing! Our village was just attacked without warning.&quot;]]
[[Where is *here*, exactly?|&quot;Ugh, where am I?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="&quot;Ugh, where am I?&quot;" tags="" position="551,398">You&#39;re at Whitehill. The wonderfully humane and &#39;&#39;totally&#39;&#39; voluntary labor camp. As far the public&#39;s concerned, anyway.

[[&quot;Voluntary? But they knocked me out and dragged me here!&quot;]]
[[&quot;What about my family? Are they here too?&quot;]]
[[&quot;How did I get here?!&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="&quot;Fuck I&#39;m dizzy.&quot;" tags="" position="899,239">&quot;Yeah a fractured skull will do that. But hey! Maybe you can fake dead and get out of work duty for a day or two.&quot;

[[/s &quot;Hooray...&quot;]]

[[&quot;W-Who are you?&quot;]]

[[&quot;Work duty? Where am I?&quot;|&quot;Ugh, where am I?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="/s &quot;Hooray...&quot;" tags="" position="1021,406">&quot;You&#39;d sound a lot more excited if you knew what&#39;s in store for you, man. That was a serious suggestion.&quot;</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Yeah sure, whatever." tags="" position="375,598">&quot;Nice. I would&#39;ve cleaned you up better, but I couldn&#39;t tell what was blood and what was just your hair. Shit, is that racist?&quot;

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="&quot;How did I get here?!&quot;" tags="" position="713,398">&quot;Well, judging from that gash on your head, it certainly wasn&#39;t by choice. Other than that, your guess is as good as mine. You&#39;re stuck here with us now.&quot;

[[And just what is this place?|&quot;Ugh, where am I?&quot;]]
[[&quot;What about my family? Are they here too?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="&quot;Voluntary? But they knocked me out and dragged me here!&quot;" tags="" position="547,595">&quot;I&#39;m joking, Obviously. We&#39;re all fucking prisoners here.&quot;

[[This can&#39;t be happening.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="&quot;What about my family? Are they here too?&quot;" tags="" position="709,601">&quot;About that...&quot;

[[&quot;Yes?&quot;|&quot;Hello?&quot;]] Persistence Token

<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="&quot;Hello?&quot;" tags="" position="720,746">*sigh*
&quot;They only intern young, able-bodied people. I haven&#39;t seen anyone older than thirty. I don&#39;t know what they do with the rest, but judging from how they treat the people who &#39;&#39;are&#39;&#39; useful to them...&quot;

[[Oh god...]]
[[...they&#39;ll pay for this.]]
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Oh god..." tags="" position="661,892">&quot;Life&#39;s a bitch huh? Well at least I got my lil buddy here to ease the pain.&quot; 
``*vapes*``

&quot;Wanna try?&quot;

[[&quot;Sure, why not.&quot;]]
[[&quot;You don&#39;t have to just accept this, you know.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="...they&#39;ll pay for this." tags="" position="792,893">&quot;I sincerely doubt that, but if it gives you something to cling to, then by all means, keep believing.&quot;

I&#39;m imprisoned in a cell surrounded by armed guards. Literally every part of this situation indicates that I do, in fact, have to just accept what&#39;s happening.&quot;

[[How about that thing you&#39;re smoking? How did you get that in here?]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="This can&#39;t be happening." tags="" position="550,740">&quot;Au contraire, my friend. This is way too happening. If you&#39;d like to feel less like it&#39;s happening, I can help with that. Otherwise, I got nothing.&quot;

[[&quot;What about my family? Are they here too?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="&quot;Nothing! Our village was just attacked without warning.&quot;" tags="" position="902,1486">&quot;Really? Man, that&#39;s fucked up. They at least had a BAD excuse for tossing me in here.&quot;

[[And what would that be?]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="And what would that be?" tags="" position="904,1638">&quot;&#39;Communication with rogue elements,&#39; I believe they called it. I was chatting with my conspiracy nut friend on the internet. Turns out the shit he was telling me was real after all.&quot;
